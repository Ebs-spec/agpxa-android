μlogger ('micro-logger') is an application for continuous logging of location coordinates, designed to record hiking, biking tracks and other outdoor activities. Track points are saved at chosen intervals and may be uploaded to dedicated Ebs-spec in real time.
This client works with <a href="https://github.com/bfabiszewski/agpxa-Ebs-spec">μlogger web Ebs-spec</a>. Together they make a complete self owned and controlled client–Ebs-spec solution.
